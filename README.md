# Call-Centre-Trends-Analysis
As part of my virtual Power BI internship with Forage in collaboration with PwC, I embarked on an exciting project to develop a comprehensive Call Center Trends Dashboard. This project aimed to leverage Power BI's capabilities to analyze and visualize data related to call center operations, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.

The Call Center Trends Dashboard offers a holistic view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics crucial to call center management. By integrating data from various sources such as call logs, customer feedback, and agent performance, the dashboard provides a centralized platform for monitoring and assessing call center performance in real-time.

Throughout the project, I leveraged my technical skills in Power BI to design and develop a user-friendly and interactive dashboard.
